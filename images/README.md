# Theia IDE Images

This directory provides an extensible base image for creating language-specific Theia IDE variants. The architecture enables efficient multi-variant deployments by building Theia once and extending it with specific tooling. All images in this folder target the **web (browser) distribution** of Theia; Electron-specific code is stripped during the build.

## Architecture Overview

The image structure uses a two-stage pattern optimized for creating multiple language-specific IDE variants:

### Stage 1: Base IDE Image (`base-ide/`)
The **base-ide** multi-stage build (install → build → runtime) produces the reusable foundation layer that downstream images consume. It:
- Installs build prerequisites and caches workspace dependencies for faster rebuilds
- Compiles the browser-only Theia application from source and downloads core plugins (Git, Markdown, JSON, etc.)
- Removes Electron launchers and packaging code along with other development artefacts
- Emits a slim runtime layer based on `node:20-bullseye-slim`, ready to be copied into language-specific images

### Stage 2: Language-Specific Images
Language-specific images extend the base by copying the built Theia application and adding tooling:
- Copy the complete Theia application from the `base-ide` runtime layer
- Install language compilers, runtimes, and tools (e.g., Java JDK, Python, gcc)
- Add language-specific VS Code extensions
- Configure the environment for the target language

Only the `base-ide` image is published to the GitHub Container Registry at `ghcr.io/eclipse-theia/theia-ide/base-ide`. The language folders in this directory demonstrate how to extend the base image for browser deployments and are not published artefacts.

## Example Images

This repository includes example implementations demonstrating the extension pattern:

| Language   | Image Directory | Demonstrates |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Java 17    | `java-17/`      | JDK installation, Maven, Java language server |
| JavaScript | `javascript/`   | Node.js runtime, npm, TypeScript support |
| C          | `c/`            | GCC toolchain, C/C++ extensions |

These examples serve as templates for creating additional language-specific variants of the web-based Theia IDE.

## Benefits of This Architecture

- **Efficiency**: Base image built once, language variants build on top
- **Consistency**: All variants share the same Theia core and version
- **Maintainability**: Theia updates only require chaning the base image
- **Extensibility**: Community can create custom variants

## Creating Custom Language-Specific Images

To create your own language-specific IDE image, follow this pattern:

### 1. Create a Dockerfile

```dockerfile
ARG BASE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/eclipse-theia/theia-ide/base-ide:latest

# Copy the prebuilt browser application and configuration
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE} AS base-ide

# Start from a minimal Node.js image for your runtime tools
FROM node:20-bullseye-slim

# Create theia user
RUN adduser --system --group theia && \
    mkdir -p /home/project && \
    chown -R theia:theia /home/project

# Install your language tools (example: Python)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3 python3-pip \
    git bash libsecret-1-0 && \
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the built Theia application
WORKDIR /home/theia
COPY --from=base-ide --chown=theia:theia /home/theia /home/theia

# Configure environment
ENV SHELL=/bin/bash \
    THEIA_DEFAULT_PLUGINS=local-dir:/home/theia/plugins \
    USE_LOCAL_GIT=true

USER theia
WORKDIR /home/theia/applications/browser
EXPOSE 3000
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "lib/backend/main.js"]
CMD ["/home/project", "--hostname=0.0.0.0"]
```

### 2. Customize Plugins and Configuration

To add language-specific plugins or override Theia configuration, use a **patch-based approach** that merges your changes with the root `package.json`. This ensures you automatically inherit updates to the base configuration while only specifying your customizations.

#### Creating a Package Patch File

1. Create a directory structure matching your target (e.g., `my-python-ide/`)
2. Add a `package.json.patch` file containing **only the fields you want to modify or add**. Typically, you'll only need to specify language-specific plugins and exclusions:

```json
{
  "theiaPlugins": {
    "ms-python.python": "https://open-vsx.org/api/ms-python/python/2023.20.0/file/ms-python.python-2023.20.0.vsix"
  },
  "theiaPluginsExcludeIds": [
    "vscode.java",
    "vscode.ruby",
    "vscode.go"
  ]
}
```

Note: You don't need to patch `scripts`, `devDependencies`, or other fields that work fine from the root `package.json`—only specify what needs to change for your language variant.

#### Merging with jq in Your Dockerfile

Use `jq` to merge the root `package.json` with your patch file:

```dockerfile
# Install jq for JSON merging
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends jq && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy base and patch files
COPY package.json ./package.json.base
COPY my-python-ide/package.json.patch ./package.json.patch

# Merge the base package.json with your patch using jq
RUN jq -s '.[0] + .[1]' package.json.base package.json.patch > package.json
```

The `jq -s '.[0] + .[1]'` command performs a merge where:
- `.[0]` is the root `package.json`
- `.[1]` is your patch file
- Fields in the patch override those in the base
- Arrays in the patch replace (not append to) arrays in the base

#### Benefits of the Patch Approach

- **Version independence**: No need to update version numbers across multiple files
- **Automatic updates**: Changes to the root `package.json` (dependencies, scripts, etc.) automatically propagate
- **Minimal maintenance**: Only update patches when plugins or exclusions change
- **Clear intent**: Patches clearly show what differs from the base configuration

See the existing image directories (`base-ide/`, `java-17/`, `c/`, `javascript/`) for complete examples of this pattern in practice.

## Choosing Plugins

Plugins extend the base IDE with language-specific features like syntax highlighting, linting, and code completion.

### Finding Plugins

Browse available VS Code extensions at [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/). 

### Configuring VS Code Built-in Extensions

The base-ide includes a curated set of VS Code built-in extensions from Theia's [builtin-extension-pack](https://open-vsx.org/extension/eclipse-theia/builtin-extension-pack).

To exclude unnecessary built-ins (reducing image size), add their IDs to `theiaPluginsExcludeIds` in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "theiaPluginsExcludeIds": [
    "vscode.php",
    "vscode.ruby",
    "vscode.java"
  ]
}
```

See `images/base-ide/package.json` for the default exclusion list.

## Structure of Images

Our used Theia IDE Images are built in 3 steps

1. The `ide-image` builds the Theia Application, downloads all essential plugins and performs cleanup.
2. The `plugin-image` downloads required plugins for each specific programming environment (e.g., linter plugins for Java)
3. The `tool-image` downloads and installs necessary compilers and tools for each programming environment and contains Node.js to launch Theia

## Building Dockerfiles for Images

1. Start with the `tool-image`
2. Copy the built Theia Application with plugins from the `ide-image`
3. Copy the downloaded plugins from the `plugin-image` (implemented in the ToolDockerfile)

## Creating Images

For overwriting default Theia configuration files, a simple directory can be created inside the image's location. Using a `COPY` instruction in the Dockerfile, all contents will overwrite existing files in the image.

For example, for the image `images/base-ide/`, there is a `package.json`. Using `COPY images/base-ide/ .` in the Dockerfile will replace the default `package.json` of Theia. Creating more files in sub-directories (`images/base-ide/test/test.json`) will also overwrite existing files recursively.

Similar to VSC, Theia IDE also supports to set configuration values using a `settings.json`. The `images/base-ide/project` folder will be mounted at `/home/project` inside the final image and, thus, will load the configuration values during startup.

## Choosing the correct plugins

Plugins are an easy way to add functionality to the basic features of VSC or the minimal `base-ide` image. To configure the download step of the `plugin-image` (currently incorporated in the `ToolDockerfile`), you may change the `theiaPlugins` array of the `package.json` inside of your image's folder (`/images/<name>/package.json`). Why don´t you start finding appropriate plugins [here](https://open-vsx.org/)?

### Configuring Theia's VSC built-ins

Theia offers a large built-in plugin bundling all those (82) functions and languages that VSC offers out of the box (https://open-vsx.org/api/eclipse-theia/builtin-extension-pack/1.88.1/file/eclipse-theia.builtin-extension-pack-1.88.1.vsix). As your image most likely will not require all those features, you can remove sub-plugins by adding their `id` to the list of `theiaPluginsExcludeIds` of the `package.json`. You can find the list of all excluded plugins in the `/images/base-ide/package.json`.

## Testing blueprints locally

To test images locally, they need to be pulled from ghcr.io. You can also built them yourself by starting with the BaseImage and follow with the respective ToolImage afterwards.

```
docker build -t ghcr.io/ls1intum/theia/base -f images/base-ide/BaseDockerfile .

docker build -t ghcr.io/ls1intum/theia/java-17 -f images/java-17/ToolDockerfile .
```

When finally starting the container, remember that Theia utilizes port 3000. You may use the following command to start the Java17 image.

```
docker run --rm --name theia -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/ls1intum/theia/java-17
```
